      "problem": "AtoZ (Amazon's internal platform for managing associates/employees) had a login page built in native iOS/Android. There were multiple issues: the AtoZ codebase was mostly already on React Native and we wanted to migrate to React Native to better integrate with other features. The native iOS/Android codebase was very tedious to update - a developer would have to update both codebases with different development principles, doubling development time. We also needed to learn how both sides of the codebases work, adding extra overhead.",
      "solution": "Contributed to complete migration from native iOS/Android to React Native under Arthur's leadership. Recreated 8+ authentication screens with enhanced accessibility features. Migrated 100+ metrics from native iOS/Android and eliminated redundant metrics. Implemented React Context, session management, demo mode, and logging systems. I was in charge of creating the new authentication screens based on provided Figma and old design, and enhancing accessibility features to make the login screen born accessible with great coverage on screen sizes and good screen reader functionality.",
      "impact": "The React Native migration cut development time in half by merging them into one codebase, ensured the login of AtoZ was modernized like the rest of the app, and improved code readability, metrics, and accessibility while doing the migration.",
